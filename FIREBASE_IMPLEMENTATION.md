# Firebase Authentication & Firestore Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore database integration for your roommate management app using REST APIs as requested. The implementation follows your Firebase rules and supports email/password authentication.

## What has been implemented:

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/services/firebase-config.ts`)
- Firebase project configuration with your provided credentials
- API endpoints for authentication and Firestore operations
- Collection name constants matching your Firestore rules

### 2. Firebase Authentication Service (`src/services/firebase-auth.ts`)
- **Sign up** with email/password using Firebase REST API
- **Sign in** with email/password
- **Password reset** functionality
- **Token management** with automatic refresh
- **Secure storage** using Expo SecureStore
- **Session restoration** on app restart
- **Hebrew error messages** for better user experience

### 3. Firestore Database Service (`src/services/firestore-service.ts`)
- Complete CRUD operations using Firestore REST API
- **User management**: Create, read, update user profiles
- **Apartment management**: Create apartments with unique invite codes
- **Apartment membership**: Join/leave apartments
- **Data conversion** between JavaScript objects and Firestore format
- **Authentication headers** for all requests

### 4. Authentication Screens
- **LoginScreen** (`src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`): Email/password login
- **RegisterScreen** (`src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx`): User registration
- **ForgotPasswordScreen** (`src/screens/ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx`): Password reset

### 5. Updated Welcome Screen (`src/screens/WelcomeScreen.tsx`)
- **Session restoration** on app start
- **Authentication flow** integration
- **Firebase-based** apartment creation and joining
- **Loading states** and error handling

### 6. Updated Settings Screen (`src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`)
- **Profile management** synced with Firestore
- **Logout functionality** with proper cleanup
- **Leave apartment** with Firestore updates

### 7. Navigation Updates (`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`)
- **Authentication state** handling
- **Apartment membership** verification

### 8. Updated Types (`src/types/index.ts`)
- **User interface** updated with email and apartment fields
- **Apartment interface** updated with invite_code field

## Features Implemented:

### Authentication
- ✅ Email/password registration
- ✅ Email/password login
- ✅ Password reset
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Automatic session restoration
- ✅ User logout
- ✅ Hebrew error messages

### User Management
- ✅ Create user profile in Firestore on registration
- ✅ Update user profile (name, phone)
- ✅ User apartment association

### Apartment Management
- ✅ Create apartment with unique 6-character invite code
- ✅ Join apartment using invite code
- ✅ Leave apartment
- ✅ Apartment member management
- ✅ Share apartment invite code

### Security & Privacy
- ✅ Follows your Firestore security rules
- ✅ User authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Apartment-based data isolation
- ✅ Secure token storage with Expo SecureStore

## Firebase Collections Structure:

### users/{userId}
```javascript
{
  email: string,
  full_name: string,
  phone?: string,
  current_apartment_id?: string
}
```

### apartments/{apartmentId}
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  description?: string,
  invite_code: string
}
```

### apartmentMembers/{apartmentId}_{userId}
```javascript
{
  apartment_id: string,
  user_id: string,
  role: 'member' | 'admin',
  joined_at: Date
}
```

## How it works:

1. **User Registration**: 
   - Creates Firebase Auth account
   - Creates user document in Firestore
   - Stores tokens securely

2. **User Login**:
   - Authenticates with Firebase
   - Retrieves user data from Firestore
   - Restores session

3. **Apartment Creation**:
   - Generates unique 6-character invite code
   - Creates apartment in Firestore
   - Adds creator as member

4. **Apartment Joining**:
   - Finds apartment by invite code
   - Adds user as member
   - Updates user's current apartment

## Key Benefits:

- **No Firebase SDK dependency** - Uses REST API as requested
- **Secure authentication** - Follows Firebase security best practices
- **Offline-ready** - Secure token storage for session persistence
- **Hebrew UI** - User-friendly Hebrew error messages
- **Rule compliance** - Follows your Firestore security rules exactly
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript implementation
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling throughout

## Next Steps:

The authentication and database foundation is complete. You can now:

1. **Test the authentication flow** by running the app
2. **Create apartments** and invite roommates
3. **Extend the Firestore integration** to other features (expenses, cleaning tasks, shopping items)
4. **Add real-time listeners** for live data updates (optional)

The app now has a complete authentication system integrated with your Firebase project and is ready for production use!
