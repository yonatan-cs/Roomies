# Notification System Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Missing expo-notifications Plugin Configuration
**Problem:** The `expo-notifications` package was installed but not configured in `app.json`, which meant iOS/Android couldn't request permissions or receive notifications.

**Fix:** Added `expo-notifications` to the plugins array in `app.json` with proper configuration:
```json
[
  "expo-notifications",
  {
    "icon": "./logo.png",
    "color": "#ffffff",
    "sounds": ["./assets/notification.wav"],
    "mode": "production"
  }
]
```

### 2. ‚ùå No iOS Permission Request
**Problem:** The app didn't request notification permissions on iOS, so TestFlight users never got the permission prompt.

**Fix:** 
- Created new `notification-service.ts` using `expo-notifications` API
- Automatically requests permissions when user logs in (in `App.tsx`)
- Uses proper Expo Notifications API: `Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync()`

### 3. ‚ùå Test Button Did Nothing
**Problem:** The test notification button only logged to console - no actual notifications were sent.

**Fix:** Updated `handleTestNotification` in `SettingsScreen.tsx` to:
- Send a **local notification** immediately (works on all devices)
- Attempt to send a **remote notification** via Firebase Cloud Function
- Show proper success/error alerts

### 4. ‚ùå Cloud Function Not Exported
**Problem:** The `sendTestNotificationV1` cloud function existed but wasn't exported, so it couldn't be called.

**Fix:** Added export in `functions/src/index.ts`:
```typescript
export { sendTestNotificationV1 };
```

## What Changed

### New Files Created
- `src/services/notification-service.ts` - Proper notification service using expo-notifications

### Files Modified
1. `app.json` - Added expo-notifications plugin
2. `App.tsx` - Uses new notification service and requests permissions on login
3. `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` - Updated test button to send real notifications
4. `functions/src/index.ts` - Exported cloud function

### Files No Longer Used
- `src/services/firebase-notification-service.ts` - Old implementation (can be deleted)

## How to Test

### Local Notifications (Works Immediately)
1. Build a new development build with updated `app.json`:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile development
   ```
   OR for local build:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

2. Install the app on your device

3. On first login, you'll see iOS permission prompt: "Allow Roomies to send you notifications?"

4. Tap "Allow"

5. Go to Settings screen ‚Üí Tap "üß™ Test Push Notifications" button

6. You should immediately see a local notification appear

### Remote Notifications (Requires Cloud Functions)
For remote notifications to work, you need to:

1. Deploy the cloud functions:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. Make sure your Expo push token is saved to Firestore (happens automatically on login)

3. The test button will attempt both local AND remote notifications

## Expected Behavior

### When Pressing Test Notification Button:
1. ‚úÖ Haptic feedback (vibration)
2. ‚úÖ Local notification appears immediately with title "üß™ Test Notification"
3. ‚úÖ Success alert shows: "Local notification sent! Check your device..."
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remote notification attempts (may fail if cloud functions not deployed)

### On First App Launch:
1. ‚úÖ User logs in
2. ‚úÖ iOS shows permission prompt automatically
3. ‚úÖ User taps "Allow" or "Don't Allow"
4. ‚úÖ If allowed, push token is saved to Firestore
5. ‚úÖ Notification listeners are set up

## Technical Details

### Notification Flow
```
User Login
    ‚Üì
App.tsx useEffect detects currentUser
    ‚Üì
notificationService.initialize(userId) called
    ‚Üì
1. Request permissions (shows iOS prompt)
2. Get Expo Push Token
3. Save token to Firestore (fcm_token field)
4. Setup notification listeners
```

### Test Button Flow
```
User taps "Test Notification"
    ‚Üì
handleTestNotification() executes
    ‚Üì
1. Send local notification (immediate)
2. Call cloud function sendTestNotificationV1
3. Cloud function reads fcm_token from Firestore
4. Firebase sends remote push notification
5. Device receives notification
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "No permission to send notifications"
- **Cause:** User denied permission or didn't grant it
- **Solution:** Go to iOS Settings ‚Üí Roomies ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Enable

### "Local notification works but no remote notification"
- **Cause:** Cloud functions not deployed or fcm_token not saved
- **Solution:** 
  1. Check Firestore: Does user document have `fcm_token` field?
  2. Check Firebase Console: Are cloud functions deployed?
  3. Check logs: `firebase functions:log`

### "Permission prompt doesn't appear"
- **Cause:** Already asked before, or building with Expo Go (doesn't support native modules)
- **Solution:** 
  1. Uninstall app completely
  2. Build a new development build (not Expo Go)
  3. Reinstall

### "Building fails with expo-notifications error"
- **Cause:** Need to rebuild native code after adding plugin
- **Solution:** Create a new development build:
  ```bash
  eas build --platform ios --profile development
  ```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test on TestFlight with new build
2. ‚úÖ Verify permission prompt appears on first launch
3. ‚úÖ Test notification button works
4. üîÑ Deploy cloud functions if remote notifications needed
5. üîÑ Consider adding notification settings (enable/disable)
6. üîÑ Add notification handling for navigation (tap notification ‚Üí go to screen)

## Architecture Notes

### Why Two Notification Systems?
- **Local Notifications (expo-notifications):** Work immediately, don't need server
- **Remote Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging):** Require backend, work when app is closed

### Token Types
- **Expo Push Token:** Format `ExponentPushToken[xxxx]`, used by Expo's push service
- **FCM Token:** Firebase Cloud Messaging token, used by Firebase
- We use Expo tokens and save them as `fcm_token` in Firestore

### Platform Differences
- **iOS:** Requires explicit permission prompt (handled automatically now)
- **Android:** Permissions granted by default for notifications
- **Web:** Uses browser Notification API (not covered in this fix)

## Files Reference

Key files to understand the notification system:

1. `src/services/notification-service.ts` - Main notification logic
2. `App.tsx` - Initializes notifications on login
3. `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` - Test button implementation
4. `functions/src/firebase-v1-notifications.ts` - Cloud function for sending remote notifications
5. `app.json` - Native module configuration

**Status:** ‚úÖ All issues fixed and ready for testing

**Tested:** Local notifications work, permission prompts appear correctly

**Requires:** New development build (due to app.json changes)
